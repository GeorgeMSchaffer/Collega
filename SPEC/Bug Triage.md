# Bug Triage

The working queue of bugs and minor tweaks to fold into an upcoming sprint. Jot items down here in whatever shape is quickest — a sentence is fine.

**This file is a queue, not a roadmap and not a history.** Two neighbours carry what it deliberately does not:

- `SPEC/ideas-inbox.md` — unrefined feature ideas. Nothing there is scheduled, and nothing there blocks work.
- `SPEC/archive/bug-triage-completed.md` — everything already fixed.

## Workflow

- Read this document before starting or resuming feature implementation.
- Items under `TODO` take priority over new features. Do not start a new feature while `TODO` has unresolved items unless the user explicitly approves an exception.
- When an item is fixed and its focused validation passes, **move it to `SPEC/archive/bug-triage-completed.md`** with the completion date and a concise verification note. Do not leave it here.
- Never let an item exist in two places. If a change is incomplete, unverified, or deferred, it stays in `TODO` with its status noted.

### Promote and delete

**When an item is promoted, it leaves this file.** Promotion means it has been written into a canonical spec (`SPEC/20-feature-*.md`, `SPEC/30-Contracts.md`) or scheduled into a sprint plan (`SPEC/sprints/`). At that point the spec or sprint file is its only home — delete the entry here rather than annotating it as "now scheduled as Sprint N".

This rule exists because the opposite happened: entries were promoted and kept, so this file accumulated ~1,100 words of Sprint 6/7 feature design duplicated from `SPEC/20-feature-ai-idea-assist.md` and `SPEC/sprints/sprint-06-view-as.md`, complete with a superseded decision left in place under strikethrough. A duplicate goes stale independently of its source, and then the two disagree.

Two corollaries:

- **Record reversals by deleting, never by striking through.** A struck-through decision leaves both readings in context.
- **Closed is not a status here.** An item marked "CLOSED" belongs in the completed archive, not in `TODO`.

### Scope

- Bugs and minor tweaks → `TODO` below.
- Feature ideas → `SPEC/ideas-inbox.md`.
- Design decisions that change behavior → the canonical spec first, per `CLAUDE.md`.

Keep entries short. A symptom, where it happens, and — if you know it — the cause. Longer analysis is welcome when the analysis *is* the value (a diagnosed root cause worth not re-deriving), but a scheduled feature's full design belongs in its sprint or spec file.

## TODO

* **Two admin drawers can be open at once (keyboard only).** On the five admin list pages no `OpenCreate` clears the detail-drawer state, and `DrawerShell` has neither a focus trap nor `inert` background content, so tabbing to "Add New" behind an open detail drawer opens a second drawer over the first. Not reachable with a mouse — the backdrop intercepts. Carried out of Sprint 6.5's review (finding 4, 2026-08-15) rather than fixed there: the real remedy is a focus trap in `DrawerShell`, which is wider than a paydown sprint. Pre-existing in kind — before item 7 the two surfaces were a drawer and a centered modal, so at least they looked different.

Intake returned here on 2026-08-15 when Sprint 6.5 was archived (`sprints/archive/sprint-06.5-bug-fixes-and-tweaks.md`); this is once again the pre-feature queue described above.
